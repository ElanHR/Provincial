metaTestChamber - where tournament is started, contains and runs a number of testChambers

TestChamber - creates and 

ConfigWindow.cs ln362  - runTournament launch code

init our player with a vector of random feature weights
write mutate function
call when incrementing generations (TestChamber.StrategizeStep ? ln 330)
increase generational count so that there's enough time for evolution
also when increasing generations, compute divergence and speciate

line 5 TestChamber.cpp : VisualizationDescription
- modify it so it displays our features / weights as well.
line 558 TestChamber.cpp : Test Pool.
modify it so only members of the same species compete.
- have a list of pools.
line 360 TestChamber.cpp : RunAllPairTests . we call this for every species now, instead of only the one pool per chamber as is.
line 627,638,165 TestChamber.cpp : use our player not theirs.
- search for more instances too!
line 651 TestChamber.cpp : test function. computes winning percentage, buy ratios.
- modify to also compute avg margin of victory?
- why does this only compute players[0]'s buy ratio?
line 115 TestChamber.cpp : Assign New leaders 
- pass along our leaders' decision struct as we currently pass buy order


modify line 65 of app.cpp so that we pit their AI against ours
